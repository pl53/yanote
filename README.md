Yant: Yet Another Note Tool (previously *Yanote*)

Yant is a pure commandline note tool. It supports note operations such as *add*
(of course!), *remove*, *update*, *search*, *review* (you will love this
feature), *import*, *export*, *fortune*, etc. With Yant, you can quickly find
your memory with one command. Moreover, you can do a two-step random review of
your notes! Think that you have taken tons of notes while learning something
new, and you want to fortify your new knowledge by reviewing notes from time to
time. Yant can do this perfectly for you. For each note, it first pops a note
title (e.g. a new word), then after your press <Enter>, more information shows
up (e.g. meaning of the word). The reviewing process is *random*, which means
you can avoid just reviewing the first few notes again and again.

Check it out and have fun with it!

```
git clone git@github.com:pl53/yant.git
cd yant
bash install.sh
yant --help
```

Enjoy!
